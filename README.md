## About Me

I'm a Robotics Researcher passionate about developing advanced robotic perception systems. My expertise includes developing navigation systems using SLAM algorithms, and utilizing perception sensors like stereo and RGB-D cameras, and LiDAR for autonomous navigation. I have experience in geometric computations on pointclouds, and vision processings for object detection, segmentation, and real-time feedback. Additionally, I'm skilled in ROS and integrating sensory data for comprehensive robotic solutions.

### Delta and 3rrs Robots - FUM CARE Lab

<table> <tr> <td> <img src="https://github.com/kimia-mahdinezhad/Delta-and-3RRS-Robots-Document/blob/main/Media/FUM-Delta.jpg" alt="Project Image" style="width:600px;"> </td> <td> <p>While interning at the FUM CARE Lab, I worked with two robots: FUM-Delta and FUM-3RRS. I developed a hand gesture control system for the FUM-Delta parallel robot, including commands to pick up, control, and place a ball on its disk. For the FUM-3RRS, a spatial parallel robot, I enabled movement control that allowed it to generate trajectories by manipulating roll, pitch, and yaw movements. Additionally, I implemented real-time imitation of the robot's motion using an IMU sensor.</p> <p><strong>Repository:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/kimia-mahdinezhad/Delta-and-3RRS-Robots-Document" target="_blank">View on GitHub</a></p> <p><strong>Webpage:</strong> <a href="http://fum-care.com/" target="_blank">View Eddiebot's Page</a></p> </td> </tr> </table>
